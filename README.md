### Hi, my name is Rafael. 

I could easily be Captain Haddock of the modern days, with hoodie and sneakers. I live in Norway 🇳🇴   since January 2019, but I’m from sunny Portugal 🇵🇹 . At work, I mainly develop PHP web applications. I have deep knowledge in the PHP ecosystem and Javascript too. Lately I've been diving deep into Typescript as a fullstack technology.

I’m also using React Native at work, but I don’t like to say it because I see myself as a backend developer and not frontend/mobile developer. Anyway, the app I developed has 80.000 consistent users and I feel very proud of it since it is the biggest project I made.

I've been practicing Parkour since 2007, I enjoy editing the videos of my jumps and I'm also into photography.

- 🔭  I’m currently working on **AllSpots**
- ⚙️  I use daily: `.ts`, `.tsx` and sometimes `.php`
