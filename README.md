### Hey there, I'm Rafael! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fullstack developer from Portugal living in Norway. I've been coding professionally since 2014. At work, I mainly develop PHP projects with Symfony framework, and most recently a React Native(Typescript) app with over 80 000 users. I have deep knowledge in the PHP ecosystem and Javascript too. I'm really passionate about Typescript and Nim and thats what I use outside of work.
